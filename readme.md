## Setup

### Linux (Generic)

```bash
sudo usermod -aG input $(whoami)
# Restart your machine (required)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/avitran0/deadlocked
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### NixOS

Add `"input"` to your user's `extraGroups` in `configuration.nix`:

```nix
users.users.yourname = {
  isNormalUser = true;
  extraGroups = [ "wheel" "input" ];
};
```

Then rebuild and reboot:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
sudo reboot
```

After reboot:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/avitran0/deadlocked
cd deadlocked
nix flake update
nix develop
cargo run --release
```

Everything is configured in `flake.nix` and `nix/shell.nix`.

### Fedora Atomic

```bash
grep -E '^input:' /usr/lib/group | sudo tee -a /etc/group && sudo usermod -aG input $USER
# Restart your machine (required)
git clone --recursive https://github.com/avitran0/deadlocked
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Running

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## FAQ

### Where are my configs saved?

Configs are saved in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` if set (usually `$HOME/.config`). Otherwise they're saved alongside the executable.

### How do I configure the radar?

See [radar.md](radar.md)

### Which desktop environments and window managers are supported?

**Best support:**
- GNOME (Mutter)
- KDE (KWin)

**Good support:**
- SwayWM
- Weston

**Fair support:**
- i3
- OpenBox
- XFCE

**Limited/No support:**
- Hyprland (poor X11 support)
- Other Wayland-only compositors

### I'm using Hyprland and something doesn't work

Hyprland has poor X11 support for the techniques this cheat uses. This cannot be fixed.

### I'm using Gamescope and the overlay is too small

The game still thinks it's running in 16:9 resolution. This cannot be fixed.

### My screen/overlay is black

Your compositor or window manager doesn't support transparency, or it's not enabled.

### The overlay shows but I can't click anything

The window couldn't be made click-through. This is a window manager/compositor limitation.

### The overlay doesn't show up

Your window manager doesn't support positioning or resizing windows.

### The overlay isn't on top of other windows

Your window manager doesn't support always-on-top windows.
