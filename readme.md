## Setup

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
git clone https://github.com/avitran0/deadlocked
./setup.sh
# Restart your machine (required)
```

Also make sure that the `uinput` kernel module is loaded.

Running NixOS or Fedora Atomic? See [OS-Specific Setup](os-setup.md).

## Running

```bash
./run.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> When running for the first time and on game updates,
> it will parse the map data for a fast visibility check.
> Let this run until you see all maps have been parsed.
> This will take a lot of resources, so it's best to let it run before joining a game.

## FAQ

### Where are my configs saved?

Configs are saved in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` with fallback to `$HOME/.config`. Otherwise they're saved alongside the executable.

### Which desktop environments and window managers are supported?

**Best support:**

- GNOME (Mutter)
- KDE (KWin)

**Good support:**

- SwayWM
- Weston

**Fair support:**

- i3
- OpenBox
- XFCE
- Hyprland (tweaks may be needed; no guarantees)

### I'm using Hyprland and something doesn't work

Hyprland has poor X11 support for the techniques this cheat uses, not much i can do about that.
Try another WM if possible.

### I'm using Gamescope and the overlay is too small

The game still thinks it's running in 16:9 resolution, so the cheat gets the wrong window resolution.
Try running the game without Gamescope.

### My screen/overlay is black

Your compositor or window manager doesn't support transparency, or it's not enabled.

On KDE, go into the `Display and Monitor` settings, then `Compositor`, and tick `Enable compositor on startup`.

### The overlay shows but I can't click anything

The window couldn't be made click-through. This is a window manager/compositor limitation.

### The overlay doesn't show up

Your window manager doesn't support positioning or resizing windows.

### The overlay isn't on top of other windows

Your window manager doesn't support always-on-top windows.
